Hopefully uptime won't be as sporadic and we'll experience fewer slowdowns now. You may already notice that some commands such as `>r34` and `>google` are much faster. Once these few months are over I'll have to find another place to host the bot, but let's not worry about that. Let's just enjoy what we have now!\n\nOnce again, thank you for your continued interest in Mewtwo!", color=0x8253c3)
